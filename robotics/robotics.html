      <h2 id="overview" >Overview</h2>
      <p>Robotics is the fusion of mechanics, electronics, and intelligence. Robots are machines that can sense, think, and act — used in industries, homes, and even space.</p>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics are closely intertwined fields driving the next technological revolution. While distinct, they often work together to create intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks.</p>
      <h3>Aritficial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
      <P>AI refers to the science of creating intelligent machines that can simulate human thought processes, such as:</P>
      <p>Learning: Acquiring information and rules for using it.</p>
      <p>Reasoning: Using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions.</p>
      <p>Problem-Solving: Finding solutions to challenges.</p>
      <p>Perception: Analyzing sensory data (visual, auditory).</p>
      <p>Key Takeaway: AI is the 'brain'—the software and algorithms that enable machines to think and make decisions.</p>
      <h3>Robotics</h3>
      <P>Robotics is the engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots. Robots are programmable machines that can sense their environment and interact with the physical world.</P>
      <P>Components: Robots typically include mechanical structures, sensors, and actuators (motors).</P>
      <P>Applications: Manufacturing (assembly), healthcare (surgery), logistics (warehousing), and exploration (space/deep sea).</P>
      <P>Key Takeaway: Robotics is the 'body'—the hardware that allows physical interaction and automation.</P>
      <h2>Convergence: AI-Powered Robots</h2>
      <P>The true power lies in their combination, creating smart robots (e.g., self-driving cars, advanced industrial arms). AI provides the intelligence for robots to:</P>
      <P>Adapt to changing environments (e.g., adjusting to unexpected obstacles).</P>
      <P>Adapt to changing environments (e.g., adjusting to unexpected obstacles).</P>
      <P>Communicate and interact with humans more naturally.</P>
      <P>This synergy is rapidly transforming industries, boosting efficiency, and enabling previously impossible innovations. Their impact on work, life, and the economy is profound and continues to accelerate.</P>

      <h2 id="history">A Concise History of AI and Robotics</h2>
      <p>From ancient automata to da Vinci's mechanical knight, robotics has evolved into a key part of modern technology. The first industrial robot, Unimate, was installed in 1961.</p>
      <P>The journey of intelligent machines spans centuries, but the modern fields of AI and Robotics took shape in the mid-20th century.</P>
      <h3 id="combination">Robotics: From Myth to Machine</h3>
      <P>Ancient Roots: The idea of automata (self-operating machines) dates back to ancient Greece (e.g., Archimedes' mechanisms) and other cultures, with mechanical devices designed for display or utility.</P>
      <P>1921: The Word is Coined: The term "Robot" was introduced by Czech playwright Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), derived from the Czech word robota (meaning "drudgery" or "forced labor").</P>
      <P>1954/1961: The Industrial Era: George Devol invented the Unimate, the first digitally operated and programmable robot. It was installed on a General Motors assembly line in 1961, marking the birth of the modern industrial robotics industry.</P>
      <h3 id="combination">Artificial Intelligence (AI): The Thinking Machine</h3>
      <P>1950: The Turing Test: Mathematician Alan Turing published Computing Machinery and Intelligence, proposing the Turing Test (or "Imitation Game") as a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.
1956: The Birth of the Field: The Dartmouth Summer Research Project is widely considered the official beginning of AI as a field of study. John McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" at this workshop.
1966: Early Intelligence: Researchers developed ELIZA (the first chatbot) and Shakey the Robot (the first mobile robot to reason about its surroundings), demonstrating early promise in natural language and perception.</P>
      <h3 id="combination">Modern Convergence (Since 1980s)</h3>
      <p>1980s-1990s: A focus on Machine Learning algorithms, allowing systems to improve performance without being explicitly programmed.</p>
      <p>1997: Strategic Milestones: IBM's Deep Blue defeated reigning World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov, showcasing AI's computational power.</p>
      <p>2010s: The Deep Learning Revolution: Advances in computing power and massive data sets fueled the rise of Deep Learning (advanced neural networks). This led to breakthroughs in image recognition (AlexNet, 2012) and complex strategic games (AlphaGo, 2016).</p>
      <p>2020s: Generative AI: The development of large, powerful Transformer models and Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT drove the current wave of Generative AI, fundamentally changing how machines create content and interact.</p>
