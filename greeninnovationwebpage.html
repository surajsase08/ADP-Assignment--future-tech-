    <li><h2>What is Green Innovation?</h2></li>
    <p>
        Green innovation means creating new ideas and technologies that help protect the environment.
        It focuses on reducing pollution, saving energy, and using natural resources wisely.
        Today, many modern technologies — like electric cars, solar panels, and AI systems —
        are helping us move towards a sustainable future.

    <li><h2> Green Energy Cars</h2></li>
    <p>
        Green energy cars, also known as electric vehicles (EVs), use electricity instead of petrol or diesel.
        They run on rechargeable batteries, which means they do not release harmful gases into the air.
        This helps reduce air pollution and dependence on fossil fuels.
    </p>
    <p>
        Companies like Tesla, Tata, and Hyundai are developing smart electric cars that can travel long distances
        with zero emissions. Some cars even use solar panels to charge their batteries.
        These vehicles are quiet, efficient, and are the future of clean transportation.

    <li><h2>Solar Energy</h2></li>
    <p>
        Solar energy is one of the best renewable energy sources. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity,
        which can be used to power homes, schools, factories, and even vehicles.
        It reduces the use of coal and natural gas, which are harmful to the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Solar systems are now smarter — thanks to artificial intelligence. AI can predict weather conditions
        and adjust the panels for maximum sunlight. Solar energy is clean, free, and unlimited,
        making it one of the most important parts of green innovation.

    <li><h2>AI in Electric Equipment</h2></li>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a big role in saving energy. Smart electric equipment like
        AI-powered fans, air conditioners, and lights can automatically turn off when not needed.
        This helps in reducing energy waste and lowering electricity bills.
    </p>
    <p>
        In industries, AI systems monitor energy use, detect problems early, and keep machines running efficiently.
        In electric vehicles, AI helps control battery performance and driving safety.
        AI and electricity together are creating a future where technology is both smart and green.

    <h2> Why Green Innovation Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Green innovation is not just about technology — it’s about our responsibility to protect the planet.
        By using electric vehicles, solar energy, and AI systems wisely, we can reduce pollution, save natural
        resources, and create a better world for the next generation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every small step — like switching to clean energy, planting trees, or saving power — adds up to make
        a big difference. Together, we can build a cleaner, smarter, and greener Earth.
